### Project objective
Have a discord bot able to:
- Save user's movie rating 
- Display a user's rating
- Change user's movie rating
- Remove user's movie rating
- Show top rated movies from the server
- Show lesser rated movies from the server
- Show top rated movies per category

*Maybe have a website down the road that will be able to show all the same informations (view only) as the bot commands.*

### 🚧 Future functionalities & bug fixes 🚧
- Add created/modified date to ratings
- Change command to a webhook with reactions/buttons for ratings instead of command options
- Make response hidden to all but user
- Make sure script is exited properly
- Show top rated movies
- Show worse rated movies
